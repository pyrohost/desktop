# pyro Desktop

pyro Desktop gives you all the power of the [open-source pyrodactyl panel](https://github.com/pyrohost/panel) with the comfort of a traditional desktop application. Manage your server's files, backups, and easily keep track of its health with ease.

## Running Locally

You will need the latest Node LTS and a working installation of pnpm.
1) Clone the pyro Desktop respository
2) Run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies for the desktop app
3) Run `pnpm dev` to start the dev server and run the desktop app, or `pnpm build` to build a production-ready copy of it.
